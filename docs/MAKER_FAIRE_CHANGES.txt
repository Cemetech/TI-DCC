Changes made to TI-DCC specifically for Maker Faire

1. Default address is 3 as defined near the top of
   main.z80 in DEFAULT_DCC_ADDRESS
2. Default function states defined in table near bottom of
   ctrl_evt.z80 after the label _evl_default_bankdata
3. Default throttle mode is 28-speed defined near the top of
   main.z80 in DEFAULT_DCC_ADDRESS
4. LOCK button functionality in controller view has been removed.
   Code in ctrl_evt.z80 at label _evl_graphkey_docontroller was
   commented out to make that happen.
5. Application name was changed from "TI-DCC" to "TI-DCC-F" to
   make it clear that this build is for Maker Faire.
6. [MATH] key no longer exits the app. You must hit the reset
   button on the back of the calculator to quit the app.
   This effectively puts the app into demonstration mode.
