Changes made to TI-DCC specifically for Maker Faire

1. Default address is 3 as defined near the top of
   main.z80 in DEFAULT_DCC_ADDRESS
2. Default function states defined in table near bottom of
   ctrl_evt.z80 after the label _evl_default_bankdata
3. Default throttle mode is 28-speed defined near the top of
   main.z80 in DEFAULT_DCC_ADDRESS
4. LOCK button functionality in controller view has been removed.
   Code in ctrl_evt.z80 at label _evl_graphkey_docontroller was
   commented out to make that happen.
5. Application name was changed from "TI-DCC" to "TI-DCC-F" to
   make it clear that this build is for Maker Faire.
6. [MATH] key no longer exits the app. You must hit the reset
   button on the back of the calculator to quit the app.
   This effectively puts the app into demonstration mode.
7. Function banks 2 and 3 have been disabled. The changes that
   made this possible are immediately after the label
   _evl_fnbanks_docontroller in ctrl_evt.z80
8. CFG button has been disabled. I did this by commenting out lines after
   _evl_tracekey_docontroller in ctrl_evt.z80
